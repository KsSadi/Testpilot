# Event Capture Testing Guide







































































































































































7. Adjust selectors if needed (especially xpaths)6. Run tests in Cypress environment5. Download and add to Cypress project4. Generate Cypress code3. Save events2. Delete any unwanted events1. Review captured events in test case page## Next Steps After Testing4. **File Uploads:** Actual file content is not captured, only filenames3. **Canvas/SVG:** Click coordinates on canvas/SVG elements are captured but may need manual adjustment2. **iframes:** Events inside iframes are not captured (by design)1. **Dynamic Content:** Events on dynamically loaded content require the extension to be active when content loads## Known Limitations- No noticeable lag during user interaction- Code generation: < 2s for 100 events- Database insert: < 100ms per event- Event capture: < 50ms overhead per event## Performance Expectations- [ ] XPath only when necessary (with cypress-xpath note)- [ ] Proper indentation- [ ] No commented-out code- [ ] Form field labels in comments- [ ] Navigation assertions- [ ] Stable selectors (id/name over xpath)- [ ] Clear, descriptive commentsGenerated code should have:## Cypress Code Quality Checklist**Total Expected Events:** ~15-18 (depending on page structure)   - **Expected:** 5 input events + 1 select + 1 checkbox + 1 click + 1 form_submit   - Click "Submit"   - Check "Terms and Conditions" (checkbox)   - Select country (select)   - Fill address (input)   - Fill email (input)   - Fill name (input)4. **Checkout Form**   - **Expected:** 1 input event + 1 click event + 1 navigation event   - Click "Checkout"   - Update quantity3. **Cart Page**   - **Expected:** 1 select event + 1 click event   - Click "Add to Cart"   - Select quantity2. **Product Page**   - **Expected:** 1 click event + 1 navigation event   - Click product   - Navigate to site1. **Home Page**### E-commerce Checkout Flow## Sample Test Scenario3. Verify capture-script.js is loaded correctly2. Check event in database (event_data JSON)1. Inspect element to verify it has id/name/label### Missing event details3. Check network tab for event POST request2. Verify link has `href` attribute1. Check console for "Navigation detected" messages### External links not working3. Verify using latest capture-script.js2. Reload extension1. Clear browser cache### Duplicate events still appearing4. Check server is running at configured URL3. Ensure extension is enabled2. Verify session ID matches test case1. Check browser console for errors### Events not being captured## Troubleshooting- Simple click = 1 event (just the click)- Form with 5 fields = ~5-7 events (clean, one per meaningful action)After fixes:- Simple click = 2-3 events (click, change, etc.)- Form with 5 fields = ~25-30 events (lots of duplicates)Before fixes:## Expected Event Counts   - ✅ No duplicate commands   - ✅ Includes external link handling   - ✅ Includes navigation assertions for page changes   - ✅ Uses best selectors (id, name, aria-label, etc.)   - ✅ Has meaningful comments with labels3. Verify generated code:2. Click "Generate Cypress Code"1. After capturing events, click "Save Events"### 6. Generate Cypress Code   - `pageUrl`: Original page URL   - `isExternal`: true   - `targetUrl`: External URL5. Verify the click event shows:4. Return to test case page3. **Expected:** Page redirects AND event is captured2. Click an external link1. Visit a page with external links (e.g., blog with social media links)### 5. Test External Navigation- ✅ ARIA label (`selectors.ariaLabel`)- ✅ Placeholder (`selectors.placeholder`)- ✅ Element name (`selectors.name`)- ✅ Page URL (`pageUrl`)- ✅ Label text (`selectors.label`)- ✅ XPath (`selectors.xpath`)- ✅ Element ID (`selectors.id`)Check that captured events include:### 4. Verify Event Details- ✅ Navigate to different pages- ✅ Submit forms- ✅ Upload files#### Advanced Interactions- ✅ Select radio buttons- ✅ Check/uncheck checkboxes- ✅ Select dropdown options- ✅ Fill email/password inputs- ✅ Fill text inputs- ✅ Click links (internal and external)- ✅ Click buttons#### Basic InteractionsVisit any website and perform these actions to test:### 3. Test Event Capturing4. Click "Start Capture"3. Enter the Test Case Session ID (copy from test case page)2. Enter your server URL (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8000`)1. Click the Testpilot icon in Chrome toolbar### 2. Configure Extension5. If removed, click "Load unpacked" and select: `public/cypress/chrome-extension/`4. Click "Remove" or "Reload"3. Find "Testpilot Event Capture" extension2. Enable "Developer mode" (top right)1. Navigate to `chrome://extensions` in Chrome### 1. Update Chrome Extension## Quick Start
